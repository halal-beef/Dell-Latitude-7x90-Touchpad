# Windows 7/8/8.1 Drivers For The ALPS Touchpads In The Dell Latitude 7x90

## What does the "x" in "Latitude 7x90" mean?

There are 3 modules of the Dell Latitude series that i know share the same touchpad hardware, instead of writing 7290, 7390 and 7490 i decided to write 7x90 to save space and save me time

## Why did i do this?

For people who installed a windows version Dell says are "unsupported" they'll soon quickly realise the touchpad wont work at all in windows 7 or will work in windows 8.1 albiet very buggy if lucky

I wanted to help such people out


## What would i lose over the actual windows precision drivers if they were on windows 8/8.1?

Nothing really, at most probably like that cool zoom feature if you get what i mean

## Prerequisites

Make sure "Disable Driver Signature Enforcement" is enabled

Make sure you have the "Intel Serial IO" driver installed

## Tutorial

Download the repo, find the folder suitable to your windows version and then run "DPInst.exe"

Allow any unsigned driver installs

Press yes to any UAC Prompts

Finished :D
